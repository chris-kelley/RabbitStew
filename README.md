When we were kids, we played Zorg on a Commodore 64 computer. We have always wanted to build a similar game, and recently discovered that there is a resurgence of these text only games, so we decided to work on developing our own.

The biggest purpose behind this project is to build upon our meager skills as programmers. If you're following this, be prepared for it to be a slow process.

We initially decided to write this using text files for the main storage of information for the game. Further discussions led to the decision to continue with the text files until we have an operational game, then work toward porting all the data to database storage. Again, this will be a learning experience for us, so we're not concerned with whether the program should be built one way or another.
